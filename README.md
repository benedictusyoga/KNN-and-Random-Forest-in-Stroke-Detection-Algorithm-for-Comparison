# Machine Learning models in Stroke Detection Algorithms
<hr>

## About
This repository holds the necessary codes for the Research Paper "Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for a Stroke Detection System"

## Brief Overview
The [Dataset](Dataset/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv) folder contains the datasets presented in a csv extension that will be used in the program and the
[KNN Model](KNN_Model.ipynb) and the [Random Forest Model](RandomForest_Model.ipynb) holds the code of the particular model that will be compared in the paper.
